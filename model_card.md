# Model Card — Perovskite Stability ML

## Intended Use
Rapid pre-screening of ABX₃ (halide perovskites) for geometric and chemical stability tendencies, guiding down-selection in materials discovery pipelines.

## Data
- Synthetic dataset constructed from plausible ionic radii and Pauling electronegativities for A∈{K,Rb,Cs}, B∈{Ge,Sn,Pb}, X∈{Cl,Br,I}.
- Descriptors include Goldschmidt t, octahedral μ, and electronegativity gaps. Labels are generated by a smoothed rule around classical windows with injected noise, avoiding trivial leakage.

## Model
- Logistic Regression (scaled) and Random Forest, both with probability calibration.
- Primary metric: ROC-AUC; also PR-AUC, F1; calibration via Brier score.

## Metrics
- Typical synthetic performance (hold-out): ROC-AUC ≈ 0.85–0.92, F1 in a comparable range, Brier reasonable. Slices by halide and B-cation do not collapse.

## Explainability
- SHAP global summary and local waterfalls. Findings: μ and t dominate; Δχ_BX modifies the decision boundary as expected.

## Ethical Considerations
- Synthetic, rule-based data; do not over-claim. Not a substitute for DFT/experiment. Use as a triage tool, not a final arbiter.

## Limitations & Next Steps
- Integrate real datasets; validate against curated experimental compilations.
- Active learning for boundary exploration; conformal prediction for coverage guarantees.
- Physics-informed/graph models when crystal structures are available.
